Create your own scripts


# How to use
It is not necessary that you have a lot of experience as a programmer but you should know a little
This needs no explanation. If you have any questions, you can google it, I did it myself to learn.


# Biography
I am a beginner programmer who was interested in programming to exploit roblox and learned some basic programming thanks to it, now I want to focus on creating games on the roblox platform. I leave you some of the code that I stole and repaired from Da Hood. Enjoy. And if you don't know English, this was translated by google.

# Support
It is recommended that the scripts run on KRNL, Synapse X, ScriptWare, Fluxus or Oxygen U. Don't use JJSploit or any exploit that uses the WRD (WereAreDevs) API, it's also terrible and has a reputation for malware.
